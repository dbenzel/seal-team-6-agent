# Project Context

Read `agents.md` in the project root — it is the entry point for all agentic guidance, engineering best practices, and language-specific conventions.

Always read `docs/agentic/guardrails.md` before taking any actions. Follow other references in `agents.md` as they become relevant to your current task — do not pre-read all referenced files.

Pay special attention to:
- The stack detection table in `agents.md` — load language guides matching this project's stack
- `.seal-team-6-overrides.md` (if it exists) — local overrides take precedence
