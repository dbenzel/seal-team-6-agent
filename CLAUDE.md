# Project Context

Read `agents.md` in the project root for comprehensive agentic guidance, engineering best practices, and language-specific conventions.

Read all files referenced within `agents.md` before starting work. Pay special attention to:
- `docs/agentic/guardrails.md` — read this before taking any actions
- The stack detection table in `agents.md` — load language guides matching this project's stack
- `.seal-team-6-overrides.md` (if it exists) — local overrides take precedence
